# Mall-Customers-Clustering-DataScience-Projects
In this project, we analyze a dataset of mall customers to understand their characteristics, preferences, and behaviors. By applying data analysis techniques and clustering algorithms, we aim to identify customer segments based on their shopping patterns and Annual Income
## Dataset Description
The dataset is provided in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, where each row represents a customer and each column represents a specific attribute. The dataset includes the following information:
+ ### CustomerID:
   Unique identifier for each customer.
+ ### Gender:
  Gender of the customer (male or female).
+ ### Age:
  Age of the customer.
+ ### Annual Income:
  Annual income of the customer in monetary units.
+ ### Spending Score:
  A score assigned to the customer based on their shopping behavior and spending patterns.

The dataset aims to identify meaningful customer segments or clusters based on their demographic information and spending behavior.
## Problem Statement:
The problem addressed by the Mall Customer Cluster Dataset is to segment customers based on their shopping behavior and demographic information. The dataset aims to answer questions such as:

+ Can we identify distinct customer segments or clusters based on their spending patterns?
+ What are the key demographic factors that influence customer behavior in the mall?
+ How can we develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments?
